Installation
************

Generic requirements
====================

* Python 2.6 or later, 3.2 or later, PyPy 2.0 or later, PyPy3 2.3 or later. It
  is the only non-optional requirement.

  .. warning:
     It is highly advised to use UCS-4 version of Python because UCS-2 version
     uses significantly slower text processing (length determination and
     non-printable character replacement) functions due to the need of
     supporting unicode characters above U+FFFF which are represented as
     surrogate pairs. This price will be paid even if configuration has no such
     characters.

* C compiler. Required to build powerline client on linux. If it is not present
  then powerline will fall back to shell script or python client.
* ``socat`` program. Required for shell variant of client which runs a bit
  faster than python version of the client, but still slower than C version.
* ``psutil`` python package. Required for some segments like cpu_percent. Some
  segments have linux-only fallbacks for ``psutil`` functionality.
* ``mercurial`` python package (note: *not* standalone executable). Required to
  work with mercurial repositories.
* ``pygit2`` python package or ``git`` executable. Required to work with ``git``
  repositories.
* ``bzr`` python package (note: *not* standalone executable). Required to work
  with bazaar repositories.
* ``pyuv`` python package. Required for :ref:`libuv-based watcher
  <config-common-watcher>` to work.
* ``i3-py``, `available on github <https://github.com/ziberna/i3-py>`_. Required
  for i3wm bindings and segments.

.. note::
    Until mercurial and bazaar support Python-3 or PyPy powerline will not
    support repository information when running in these interpreters.

.. _repository-root:

.. note::
   When using ``pip`` ``{repository_root}`` directory referenced in
   documentation may be found using ``pip show powerline-status``. In the output
   of ``pip show`` there is a line like ``Location: {path}``, that ``{path}`` is
   ``{repository_root}``. Unless it is ``--editable`` installation this is only
   applicable for ``{repository_root}/powerline/…`` paths: something like
   ``{repository_root}/scripts/powerline-render`` is not present.

   When using other packages referenced paths may not exist, in this case refer
   to package documentation.

Pip installation
================

Due to a naming conflict with an unrelated project powerline is available on
PyPI under the ``powerline-status`` name:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install powerline-status

is the preferred method because this will get the latest release. To get current
development version

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install --user git+git://github.com/powerline/powerline

may be used. If powerline was already checked out into some directory

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install --user --editable={path_to_powerline}

is useful, but note that in this case ``pip`` will not install ``powerline``
executable and something like

.. code-block:: sh

    ln -s {path_to_powerline}/scripts/powerline ~/.local/bin

will have to be done (:file:`~/.local/bin` should be replaced with some path
present in ``$PATH``).

.. note::
    If ISP blocks git protocol for some reason github also provides ``ssh``
    (``git+ssh://git@github.com/powerline/powerline``) and ``https``
    (``git+https://github.com/powerline/powerline``) protocols. ``git`` protocol
    should be the fastest, but least secure one though.

Fonts installation
==================

Powerline uses several special glyphs to get the arrow effect and some custom
symbols for developers. This requires having either a symbol font or a patched
font installed in the system. Used application (e.g. terminal emulator) must
also either be configured to use patched fonts (in some cases even support it
because custom glyphs live in private use area which some applications reserve
for themselves) or support fontconfig for powerline to work properly with
powerline-specific glyphs.

:ref:`24-bit color support <config-common-term_truecolor>` may be enabled if
used terminal emulator supports it (see :ref:`the terminal emulator support
matrix <usage-terminal-emulators>`).

There are basically two ways to get powerline glyphs displayed: use
:file:`PowerlineSymbols.otf` font as a fallback for one of the existing fonts or
install a patched font.

.. _installation-patched-fonts:

Patched fonts
-------------

This method is the fallback method and works for every terminal.

Download the font from `powerline-fonts`_. If preferred font can’t be found in
the `powerline-fonts`_ repo, then patching the preferred font is needed instead.

.. _powerline-fonts: https://github.com/powerline/fonts

After downloading this font refer to platform-specific instructions.
