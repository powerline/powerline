Requirements
============

Powerline requires Python 3.3 or Python 2.7 to work.

Vim plugin requirements
-----------------------

The vim plugin requires a vim version with Python support compiled in.  You 
can check if your vim supports Python by running ``vim --version | grep 
+python``.

If your vim version doesn't have support for Python, you'll have to compile 
it with the ``--enable-pythoninterp`` flag (``--enable-python3interp`` if 
you want Python 3 support instead). Note that this also requires the related 
Python headers to be installed on your system. Please consult your 
distribution's documentation for details on how to compile and install 
packages.

Vim version 7.3.661 or newer is recommended for performance reasons.

Terminal emulator requirements
------------------------------

Powerline uses several special glyphs to get the arrow effect and some 
custom symbols for developers. This requires that you either have a symbol 
font or a patched font on your system. Your terminal emulator must also 
support either patched fonts or fontconfig for Powerline to work properly.

You can also enable :ref:`24-bit color support <config-common-term_truecolor>` 
if your terminal emulator supports it.

Optional dependencies
---------------------

The following software is not required by all segments, but recommended for 
optimal performance and extra features:

Python packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``pygit2``
* ``mercurial``
* ``psutil``

Other applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``git`` version 1.7.2 and later. Not needed if you have ``pygit2``.

Installation
============

* :ref:`installation-linux`
* :ref:`installation-osx`

Usage
=====

Vim statusline
--------------

Add the following line to your :file:`vimrc`, where ``{repository_root}`` is the 
absolute path to your Powerline installation directory:

.. code-block:: vim

   set rtp+={repository_root}/powerline/bindings/vim

If you're using Vundle or Pathogen and don't want Powerline functionality in 
any other applications, simply add Powerline as a bundle and point the path 
above to the Powerline bundle directory, e.g. 
``~/.vim/bundle/powerline/powerline/bindings/vim``. For vim-addon-manager it is 
even easier since you donâ€™t need to write this big path or install anything by 
hand: ``powerline`` is installed and run just like any other plugin using

.. code-block:: vim

    call vam#ActivateAddons(['powerline'])

Shell prompts
-------------

Bash prompt
^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the following line to your :file:`bashrc`, where ``{repository_root}`` is 
the absolute path to your Powerline installation directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   . {repository_root}/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh

Zsh prompt
^^^^^^^^^^

Add the following line to your :file:`zshrc`, where ``{repository_root}`` is the 
absolute path to your Powerline installation directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   . {repository_root}/powerline/bindings/zsh/powerline.zsh

If you are not satisfied with powerline speed in this case, compile zpython 
branch from https://bitbucket.org/ZyX_I/zsh.

Tmux statusline
---------------

Add the following line to your :file:`tmux.conf`, where ``{repository_root}`` is 
the absolute path to your Powerline installation directory::

   source '{repository_root}/powerline/bindings/tmux/powerline.conf'

IPython prompt
--------------

For IPython<0.11 add the following lines to your 
:file:`.ipython/ipy_user_conf.py`::

    # top
    from powerline.bindings.ipython.pre_0_11 import setup as powerline_setup

    # main() function (assuming you launched ipython without configuration to 
    # create skeleton ipy_user_conf.py file):
    powerline_setup()

For IPython>=0.11 add the following line to your :file:`ipython_config.py` 
file in the profile you are using::

    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = [
        'powerline.bindings.ipython.post_0_11'
    ]

IPython=0.11* is not supported and does not work. IPython<0.10 was not 
tested (not installable by pip).

Awesome widget
--------------

.. note:: Powerline currently only supports awesome 3.5.

.. note:: The Powerline widget will spawn a shell script that runs in the 
   background and updates the statusline with ``awesome-client``.

Add the following to your :file:`rc.lua`, where ``{repository_root}`` is the 
absolute path to your Powerline installation directory:

.. code-block:: lua

   package.path = package.path .. ';{repository_root}/powerline/bindings/awesome/?.lua'
   require('powerline')

Then add the ``powerline_widget`` to your ``wibox``:

.. code-block:: lua

   right_layout:add(powerline_widget)

Qtile widget
------------

Add the following to your :file:`~/.config/qtile/config.py`:

.. code-block:: python

   from powerline.bindings.qtile.widget import Powerline

   screens = [
       Screen(
           top=bar.Bar([
                   # ...
                   Powerline(timeout=2),
                   # ...
               ],
           ),
       ),
   ]
