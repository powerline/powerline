Shell prompts
*************

.. note::
    Powerline daemon is not run automatically by any of my bindings. It is
    advised to add

    .. code-block:: bash

        powerline-daemon -q

    before any other powerline-related code in the shell configuration file.

Bash prompt
===========

Add the following line to the :file:`bashrc`, where ``{repository_root}`` is the
absolute path to the Powerline installation directory (see :ref:`repository root
<repository-root>`):

.. code-block:: bash

   . {repository_root}/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh

.. note::
    Since without powerline daemon bash bindings are very slow PS2
    (continuation) and PS3 (select) prompts are not set up. Thus it is advised
    to use

    .. code-block:: bash

       powerline-daemon -q
       POWERLINE_BASH_CONTINUATION=1
       POWERLINE_BASH_SELECT=1
       . {repository_root}/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh

    in the bash configuration file. Without ``POWERLINE_BASH_*`` variables PS2
    and PS3 prompts are computed exactly once at bash startup.

.. warning::
    At maximum bash continuation PS2 and select PS3 prompts are computed each
    time main PS1 prompt is computed. Thus putting e.g. current time into PS2 or
    PS3 prompt will not work as expected.

    At minimum they are computed once on startup.

Zsh prompt
==========

Add the following line to the :file:`zshrc`, where ``{repository_root}`` is the
absolute path to the Powerline installation directory (see :ref:`repository root
<repository-root>`):

.. code-block:: bash

   . {repository_root}/powerline/bindings/zsh/powerline.zsh

Fish prompt
===========

Add the following line to :file:`config.fish`, where ``{repository_root}`` is
the absolute path to the Powerline installation directory (see :ref:`repository
root <repository-root>`):

.. code-block:: bash

   set fish_function_path $fish_function_path "{repository_root}/powerline/bindings/fish"
   powerline-setup

.. warning:: Fish is supported only starting from version 2.1.

Rcsh prompt
===========

Powerline supports Plan9 rc reimplementation *by Byron Rakitzis* packaged by
many \*nix distributions. To use it add

.. code-block:: bash

   . {repository_root}/powerline/bindings/rc/powerline.rc

(``{repository_root}`` is the absolute path to the Powerline installation
directory, see :ref:`repository root <repository-root>`) to :file:`rcrc` file
(usually :file:`~/.rcrc`) and make sure ``rc`` is started as a login shell (with
``-l`` argument): otherwise this configuration file is not read.

.. warning::
   Original Plan9 shell and its \*nix port are not supported because they are
   missing ``prompt`` special function (it is being called once before each
   non-continuation prompt). Since powerline could not support shell without
   this or equivalent feature some other not-so-critical features of that port
   were used.

Busybox (ash), mksh and dash prompt
=====================================

After launching busybox run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   . {repository_root}/powerline/bindings/shell/powerline.sh

where ``{repository_root}`` is the absolute path to the Powerline installation
directory (see :ref:`repository root <repository-root>`).

Mksh users may put this line into ``~/.mkshrc`` file. Dash users may use the
following in ``~/.profile``:

.. code-block:: bash

    if test "x$0" != "x${0#dash}" ; then
        export ENV={repository_root}/powerline/bindings/shell/powerline.sh
    fi

.. note::
    Dash users that already have ``$ENV`` defined should either put the ``.
    â€¦/shell/powerline.sh`` line in the ``$ENV`` file or create a new file which
    will source (using ``.`` command) both former ``$ENV`` file and
    :file:`powerline.sh` files and set ``$ENV`` to the path of this new file.

.. warning::
    Mksh users have to set ``$POWERLINE_SHELL_CONTINUATION`` and
    ``$POWERLINE_SHELL_SELECT`` to 1 to get PS2 and PS3 (continuation and
    select) prompts support respectively: as command substitution is not
    performed in these shells for these prompts they are updated once each time
    PS1 prompt is displayed which may be slow.

    It is also known that while PS2 and PS3 update is triggered at PS1 update it
    is *actually performed* only *next* time PS1 is displayed which means that
    PS2 and PS3 prompts will be outdated and may be incorrect for this reason.

    Without these variables PS2 and PS3 prompts will be set once at startup.
    This only touches mksh users: busybox and dash both have no such problem.

.. warning::
    Job count is using some weird hack that uses signals and temporary files for
    interprocess communication. It may be wrong sometimes. Not the case in mksh.

.. warning::
    Busybox has two shells: ``ash`` and ``hush``. Second is known to segfault in
    busybox 1.22.1 when using :file:`powerline.sh` script.
