Fix terminal timeout when pressing escape
-----------------------------------------

When you're pressing :kbd:`Escape` to leave insert mode in the terminal, it 
will by default take a second or another keystroke to leave insert mode 
completely and update the statusline. If you find this annoying, you can add 
the following snippet to your :file:`vimrc` to escape insert mode 
immediately:

.. code-block:: vim

   if ! has('gui_running')
       set ttimeoutlen=10
       augroup FastEscape
           autocmd!
           au InsertEnter * set timeoutlen=0
           au InsertLeave * set timeoutlen=1000
       augroup END
   endif

Useful settings
---------------

You may find the following vim settings useful when using the Powerline 
statusline:

.. code-block:: vim
   
   set laststatus=2 " Always display the statusline in all windows
   set noshowmode " Hide the default mode text (e.g. -- INSERT -- below the statusline)

Terminus font and urxvt
=======================

The Terminus fonts does not have the powerline glyths and unless someone submits a patch to 
the font author, it is unlikely to happen.  However, Andre KlÃ¤rner came up with this work around: 
In your ``~/.Xdefault`` file add the following:

``urxvt*font: xft:Terminus:pixelsize=12,xft:Inconsolata\ for\ Powerline:pixelsize=12``

This will allow urxvt to fallback onto the Inconsolata fonts in case it does not find the right 
glyths within the terminus font.

Source Code Pro font and urxvt
==============================

Much like the terminus font that was mentioned above, a similar fix can be applied to the Source Code Pro fonts.

In the ``~/.Xdefaults`` add the following:

``URxvt*font: xft:Source\ Code\ Pro\ Medium:pixelsize=13:antialias=true:hinting=true,xft:Source\ Code\ Pro\ Medium:pixelsize=13:antialias=true:hinting=true``

I noticed that Source Code Pro has the glyphs there already, but the pixel size of the fonts play a role in whether or not
the > or the < separators showing up or not.   Using font size 12, glyphs on the right hand side of the powerline are present, 
but the ones on the left don't.  Pixel size 14, brings the reverse problem.  Font size 13 seems to work just fine.
