# uuencode:  file(1) magic for ASCII-encoded files
#

# GRR:  the first line of xxencoded files is identical to that in uuencoded
# files, but the first character in most subsequent lines is 'h' instead of
# 'M'.  (xxencoding uses lowercase letters in place of most of uuencode's
# punctuation and survives BITNET gateways better.)  If regular expressions
# were supported, this entry could possibly be split into two with
# "begin\040\.\*\012M" or "begin\040\.\*\012h" (where \. and \* are REs).

# btoa(1) is an alternative to uuencode that requires less space.

# ship(1) is another, much cooler alternative to uuencode.
