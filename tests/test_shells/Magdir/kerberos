# kerberos: MIT kerberos file binary formats

# This magic entry is for demonstration purposes and could be improved
# if the following features were implemented in file:
#
# Strings inside [[ .. ]] in the descriptions have special meanings and
# are not printed.
#
# 	- Provide some form of iteration in number of components
#		[[${counter}=%d]] in the description
#		then append
#		[${counter}--] in the offset of the entries
#	- Provide a way to round the next offset
#		Add [R:4] after the offset?
#	- Provide a way to have optional entries
#		XXX: Syntax:
#	- Provide a way to "save" entries to print them later.
#		if the description is [[${name}=%s]], then nothing is
#		printed and a subsequent entry in the same magic file
#		can refer to ${name}
#	- Provide a way to format strings as hex values
