# icc:  file(1) magic for International Color Consortium file formats

#
# Color profiles as per the ICC's "Image technology colour management -
# Architecture, profile format, and data structure" specification.
# See
#
#	http://www.color.org/specification/ICC1v43_2010-12.pdf
#
# for Specification ICC.1:2010 (Profile version 4.3.0.0).
#
# Bytes 36 to 39 contain a generic profile file signature of "acsp";
# bytes 40 to 43 "may be used to identify the primary platform/operating
# system framework for which the profile was created".
#
# There are other fields that might be worth dumping as well.
#

# This appears to be what's used for Apple ColorSync profiles.
# Instead of adding that, Apple just changed the generic "acsp" entry
# to be for "ColorSync ICC Color Profile" rather than "Kodak Color
# Management System, ICC Profile".
# Yes, it's "APPL", not "AAPL"; see the spec.
36	string		acspAPPL	ColorSync ICC Profile
!:mime	application/vnd.iccprofile

# Microsoft ICM color profile
36	string		acspMSFT	Microsoft ICM Color Profile
!:mime	application/vnd.iccprofile

# Yes, that's a blank after "SGI".
36	string		acspSGI\ 	SGI ICC Profile
!:mime	application/vnd.iccprofile

# XXX - is this what's used for the Sun KCMS or not?  The standard file
# uses just "acsp" for that, but Apple's file uses it for "ColorSync",
# and there *is* an identified "primary platform" value of SUNW.
36	string		acspSUNW	Sun KCMS ICC Profile
!:mime	application/vnd.iccprofile

# Any other profile.
# XXX - should we use "acsp\0\0\0\0" for "no primary platform" profiles,
# and use "acsp" for everything else and dump the "primary platform"
# string in those cases?
36	string		acsp		ICC Profile
