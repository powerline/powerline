# msooxml:  file(1) magic for Microsoft Office XML
# From: Ralf Brown <ralf.brown@gmail.com>

# .docx, .pptx, and .xlsx are XML plus other files inside a ZIP
#   archive.  The first member file is normally "[Content_Types].xml".
#   but some libreoffice generated files put this later. Perhaps skip
#   the "[Content_Types].xml" test?
# Since MSOOXML doesn't have anything like the uncompressed "mimetype"
#   file of ePub or OpenDocument, we'll have to scan for a filename
#   which can distinguish between the three types

# start by checking for ZIP local file header signature
0		string		PK\003\004
!:strength +10
# make sure the first file is correct
>0x1E		regex		\\[Content_Types\\]\\.xml|_rels/\\.rels
# skip to the second local file header
# since some documents include a 520-byte extra field following the file
# header, we need to scan for the next header
>>(18.l+49)	search/2000	PK\003\004
# now skip to the *third* local file header; again, we need to scan due to a
# 520-byte extra field following the file header
>>>&26		search/1000	PK\003\004
# and check the subdirectory name to determine which type of OOXML
# file we have.  Correct the mimetype with the registered ones:
